# Term-Crawler
interactive 2D Dungeon Crawler RPG written in Python for a console. you can use with WASD, have customizable options (WIP), etc.

The goal of this project is to make an entirely interactive console-based dungeon crawler, and i mean i am gonna go _ham_ with the interactiveness if i can help it. ( it's tile-based based so who cares about fps anyways )

ANY changes made will be posted here, I will try my best to keep this project active and rolling

### *warning*

**I am NOT good when it comes to writing code. my code WILL LIKELY be a bunch of spaghetti. DON'T expect to see anything remotely understandable**
If you do decide to attempt to understand my code, feel free to suggest some things! any advice is taken.

# Features as of right now
- arrow keys and WASD to move
- basic enemy movement
- 'ESC' for menu
- logs
- On screen Player stats
- Fancy looking boxes
- Map Scrolling
- Shitty code
- automatic geometry
- NPC interaction

# Why? what's wrong with you?
I did a fair bit of googling for "2D RPG dungeon crawler in console" and couldn't find anything even remotely close to what i'm currently doing. It was all text-based stuff, i swear some of you people have no imagination... it's almost like you _enjoy_ the idea of not suffering...
Also, i was bored a few days ago and thought "yeah this is a good idea" | *(spoilers, it wasn't a good idea)*
# How do i run this code?
`pip install -r requirements.txt' open the directory in a terminal, and execute "py main.py" and wallah, hopefully some random unintelligible text on your screen!
